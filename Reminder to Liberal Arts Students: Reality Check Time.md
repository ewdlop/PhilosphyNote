**Reminder to Liberal Arts Students: Reality Check Time**  

Hey there, thinkers, dreamers, and changemakers!  

It's great to have ideals, but remember—**idealism without realism is just wishful thinking**. The world isn’t a classroom discussion where the most poetic answer wins. Change doesn’t happen through feelings alone; it takes **strategy, execution, and resilience**.  

- **Theory is great, but application matters more.** Understand how systems actually work before trying to reinvent them.  
- **Not everyone thinks like you.** Persuasion requires understanding the opposition, not dismissing them.  
- **Perfection is the enemy of progress.** The world will never align perfectly with your vision—adjust, adapt, and move forward.  
- **Good intentions don’t guarantee good outcomes.** Analyze the consequences of your ideas, not just their emotional appeal.  
- **Money runs the world.** You can critique capitalism all day, but you still need to pay rent. Find ways to work within reality while pushing for better systems.  

Dream big, but **stay grounded**. The world isn’t waiting for you to write a perfect manifesto—it’s moved by those who **act effectively, not just passionately**.
